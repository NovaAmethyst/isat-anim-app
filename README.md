# Custom ISAT animation creator

An app made in Python to create custom animations mimicking [insertdisc5](https://insertdisc5.com)'s game [In Stars and Time](https://instarsandtime.come).

## Features

The application is split into two parts : one to handle the creation of actors, and one to handle the creation of scenes.

### Actors

The 'Actors' tab is used to define the actors used in a scene,
and the actions they can perform.

![Actors tab]("https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9acd0c25-ce3c-4743-976b-aecdac565fc5")

- Create actors and actions they can perform
- Create action components to define each action
- The action components can be defined using RPG Maker movement speeds, or by inputting a duration and offset manually
- The actions can be previewed

### Scenes

The 'Scenes' tab is split into two parts:
one to handle the camera,
and one to handle the actors present in the scene.

![Camera tab]("https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/005eebfd-f270-43cd-a976-2c430ac8a6fe")

- Change the camera size and starting position
- Define the movements of the camera during the scene,
either by making it follow an actor or by manually giving an offset
- Choose a background for the scene

![Scene actors tab]("https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1937136c-8b6e-4668-b8cf-864ca4758b9c")

- Choose actors from the 'Actors' tab to add to the scene
- Schedule either an idle action or one of the actions available to the actor

## Video creation

Once a scene is created,
it can be either previewed in the app or exported as an MP4 file.

For example,
here is the video of the scene defined in the demo!
